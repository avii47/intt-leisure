With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and other advanced technologies, the capacity for analytical thinking and problem-solving has reached unprecedented heights. Yet, despite these advancements, the human element—marked by emotions, biases and psychological intricacies—remains a pivotal factor in leadership effectiveness.",
