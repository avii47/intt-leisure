      "The idea of introspective leadership is built upon the practice of mindfulness (which can be more suitably termed “introspection”) based on original Buddhist teachings. This form of mindfulness (which has no association with any religion), preserved in Sri Lanka, enables practitioners to enhance their lives by following the Supernormal Eightfold Way. At Intt Leisure, we help leaders and other individuals interested in mindfulness to experience introspection in the backdrop of Sri Lanka, providing a complete understanding of the concept of mindfulness and allowing them to experience its benefits.",
      "The contemporary concept of mindfulness has been gaining popularity, especially among those in leadership positions. However, due to mistranslations and misconceptions that arose when the original concept was introduced to Western cultures in the 19th century by the British scholar Rhys Davids, recent decades have seen a proliferation of misunderstood views on mindfulness.",
      "The original concept of mindfulness is based on the Buddhist concept of Satipattana, which means introspection or awareness of the self by directing attention inward. By identifying cognitive dissonance (the disconnection between emotions and intellect) and exploring the self through exercises to follow the Supernormal Eightfold Way, one can achieve cognitive consonance for a unified mind, resulting in mental equilibrium.",
      "At INTT Leisure, supported by years of academic research by Dr. Gamini Hewawasam into the original form of mindfulness (introspection), we invite leaders and individuals interested in mindfulness to experience this journey in Sri Lanka."

      "True mindfulness is based on the Buddhist concept of “satipattana,” which means turning attention inward for self-awareness. Through identifying cognitive dissonance (the disconnect between emotions and intellect) and practicing exercises that promote introspection, one can achieve a unified mind and mental equilibrium.",
      "To study the effects of practicing mindfulness in its original, authentic form on leadership, a research project was conducted as part of a doctoral program at Benedictine University in the United States. This study explored how practicing this form of mindfulness changed perceptions and behaviors, while maintaining complete religious neutrality. The study involved a 3-month guided mindfulness workshop with 26 leaders from global and U.S. companies. It was led by four Buddhist monks, chosen for their knowledge of both early Buddhist teachings and Western professional culture.",
