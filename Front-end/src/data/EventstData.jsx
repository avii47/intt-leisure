      "Dr. Gamini Hewawasam recently appeared on TV1 to discuss the transformative role of mindfulness in leadership and societal change in Sri Lanka. He highlighted that although mindfulness, as part of the Supernormal Eightfold Way, is well-known in Sri Lanka, its practical benefits have not been fully realized. Drawing from his research on global leadership, Dr. Hewawasam emphasized that mindfulness can enhance decision-making among leaders. He also advocated for adopting the “Team of Teams” approach, promoting collaboration among smaller teams to address complex societal issues, and unlearning outdated practices that hinder development.",
      "In addition, Dr. Hewawasam stressed the importance of teaching children to “do good” rather than simply “be good,” encouraging self-reflection and personal accountability. He believes that fostering these values, along with mindfulness, can lead to ethical leadership and broader societal transformation. By nurturing future generations with these principles, Dr. Hewawasam envisions a Sri Lanka where leadership is built on integrity, transparency, and accountability, ultimately reducing corruption and paving the way for national growth and prosperity."
